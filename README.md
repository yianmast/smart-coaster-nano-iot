# Smart Coaster with Arduino Nano 33 IoT ðŸ§ â˜•ðŸ’¡

Build a Wi-Fi-enabled smart coaster that controls RGB LED lighting via the Arduino IoT Cloud. Based on the original [Instructables guide](https://www.instructables.com/Smart-Coaster-With-Arduino-Nano-33-IoT/), this project uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT to create a connected beverage coaster with cloud-controlled lighting zones.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Control 4 LED channels via Arduino IoT Cloud
- Use analogWrite to smoothly dim RGB or individual LEDs
- Create lighting patterns for drinks, ambiance, or notifications
- Fully customizable from the Arduino Cloud Dashboard

---

## ðŸ§° Components Required

- Arduino Nano 33 IoT
- 4 x LEDs (or RGB LED segments)
- Resistors for LEDs
- USB cable for programming and power
- Optional: 3D printed coaster base
- Arduino IoT Cloud account

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Overview

Each LED is connected to a separate PWM-capable pin on the Nano 33 IoT. The Arduino IoT Cloud sends values (0â€“255) to each pin to control brightness.

Refer to the `images/` folder for a detailed wiring diagram.

---

## ðŸ§  Cloud Variables

The following cloud variables control the LED outputs:

- `LED1`, `LED2`, `LED3`, `LED4` (type: `int`, access: READ/WRITE)

Each variable has an associated callback in the code that updates the brightness of the corresponding LED using `analogWrite()`.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. Set up your Arduino Nano 33 IoT on [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot).
2. Define 4 cloud variables of type `int` with READ/WRITE access.
3. Replace the `thingProperties.h` file with the one generated by your IoT Thing.
4. Upload the `SmartCoaster.ino` sketch using the Arduino IDE or Web Editor.
5. Use the dashboard to control each LEDâ€™s brightness in real time.
